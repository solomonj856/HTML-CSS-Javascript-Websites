<b>Anticipation is sweeter than realisation?</b>
<pm>It may be, yet I have not found it so.</pm>
<p>In those first golden dreams of future fame</p>
<strong>I did not find such happiness as came</strong>
<p>When toil was <span style = "color:gold;font-weight:bold">crowned</span> with triumph. Now I know</p>
<p>My words have recognition, and will go</p>
<i>Straight to some listening <span style = "color:crimson;font-weight:bolder">heart,</span> my early aim,</i>
<p>To win the idle glory of a name,</p>

<br>Pales like a candle in the noondays glow.
<p>So with the deeper joys of which I dreamed:</p>
<p>Life yields more <span style ="color:blue;font-weight:bold">rapture</span> than did childhood's fancies,</p>       
<p>And each year brings more pleasure than I waited.</p>
<em>Friendship proves truer than of old it seemed,</em>
<p>And, all beyond youth's passion-hued romances,</p>
<p>Love is more perfect than anticipated.</p>
    
<p>Refuted, Ella Wheeler</p>
